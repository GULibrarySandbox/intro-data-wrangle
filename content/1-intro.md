[OpenRefine](http://openrefine.org) is a [Java](https://www.java.com/en/)-based program that runs on your computer (not online).

It runs inside your Web browser, but no web connection is needed to use it, unless you want to bring in Web-based data for cleaning. Once data has been read into OpenRefine, no further internet connection is needed.

#### Features of OpenRefine
  
- Open source collaboratively developed software (OpenRefine source code is housed on GitHub)
- A growing community of users worldwide, from novice to expert, ready to help
- Works with large datasets, i.e. those greater than 100,000 rows
- Can adjust memory allocation to accommodate larger datasets 

#### Things you can use OpenRefine for

- Identifying where data is missing
- Identifying and fixing inconsistencies in data
- Splitting columns or rows of data up into more granular parts
- Merging columns or rows of data
- Combining multiple datasets into one
- Repeating the same step many times with different data
- Opening a dataset that is too large for Excel
- Tracking changes made to data
- Changing case within a column
- Exporting the steps as a reusable script
