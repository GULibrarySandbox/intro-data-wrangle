# Facets & Clustering – common transformations

The first feature we will explore is Facets. This is a useful feature of OpenRefine and can help you:
- get an overview of the data in a project
- get counts of data in specific columns
- help you identify missing, misspelled or inconsistent data.

A common use case for your data might be where you want to know how many times a particular value appears in a column in your data.

A 'Facet' groups all the like values that appear in a column, and then allows you to filter the data by these values 
and edit the values for a number of records in one go.

The first facet we will use is a 'Text facet'. It groups all the identical text values in a column and lists each value 
and the number of records in which that value appears. Facet information always appears in the left-hand panel 
in the OpenRefine interface.

### Activity 6 – Looking at data through Facets

Here we will use faceting to look at the values represented in the `Crash_Month` column.

Scroll over to the `Crash_Month` column.

Click the down arrow and choose `Facet > Text facet`.

In the left panel, you will now see a box containing every unique value in the `Crash_Month` column,
along with a number representing how many times that value occurs in the column.

1. Try sorting this facet by name and by count. How are they sorted?

2. Which months have the highest and lowest traffic related accidents?

{% include modal.md button="Solution" color="success" title="Activity solution" text="1. Name is alphabetical, and count is largest at top of list.

> 2. May highest, January lowest." %}
> -------------------

> #### Solution

> 1. Name is alphabetical, and count is largest at top of list.

> 2. May highest, January lowest.

> -------------------------

Close facet by clicking the `x` in top corner of the Facet panel. Always close facets when you are finished with them,
so as not to affect future facets.

Let's look at how we can amend data with Facets.

We want to limit to a sub-set of this data, with records about crashes which resulted in fatalities or hospitalisation.

### Activity 7 - Amending data through Facets

Scroll to `Crash_Severity` Column.

Click the down arrow and choose `Facet > Text facet`.

Unique values will be displayed in left hand panel.

Notice that when you click on the choices in the facet, or hover over them, `edit` and `include` functions appear.

Hover over values `Fatal and Hospitalisation` and use `include` function to narrow results just to those records.

Check how many records display? Answer should be 27528.

Now use `Exclude` to return to all records.

Use `include` function again for values `Medical treatment and Minor injury` (with 35002 results).
We will now remove all these records from our dataset.

Select `All column > Edit rows > Remove all matching rows`.

These two variables are now displayed in red and missing counts. Click reset.

How many records are now available? (27528)

Close the facet.

### Activity 8 – fixing errors with Facets

We can also edit values using the facets feature. We will use faceting to look at the `Crash_Day_of_Week Column`.

What are the results?

Hover over `MON SUN & SAT` and choose `Edit cells` to alter the abbreviated values to full words.

How many days of the week are represented now?

### More on Facets

As well as 'Text facets' and 'timeline facets', OpenRefine also supports other types of facet. These include:

- Numeric facets

- Custom facets (for numbers)

- Scatterplot facets

> **Numeric** and **Scatterplot** facets display graphs instead of lists of values. The numeric facet graph includes 'drag and drop' controls you can use to set a start and end range to filter the data displayed. These facets are explored further in Examining Numbers in OpenRefine.

> **Custom** facets provide a range of different facets. Some of the default custom facets are: (SHOW MENU)

> **Word** facet - this breaks down text into words and counts the number of records each word appears in

> **Duplicates** facet - this results in a binary facet of 'true' or 'false'. Rows appear in the 'tru' facet if the value in the selected column is an exact match for a value in the same column in another row.

> **Text length** facet - creates a numeric facet based on the length (number of characters) of the text in each row for the selected column. This can be useful for spotting incorrect or unusual data in a field where specific lengths are expected (e.g., if the values are expected to be years, any row with a text length of more than 4 for that column is likely to be incorrect.)

> **Facet by blank** - a binary facet of 'true' or 'false'. Rows appear in the 'true' facet if they have no data present in that column. This is useful when looking for missing data.

#### Exercise:  Using Facets find what data is missing in `Crash_Type` column

Work with your neighbour to find out how many records are missing crash type data?

> -----------------------------
> #### Solution

> Select Facet > Customized facets > Facet by Blank or Null

> Result: 13. All correspond to the `Crash_Nature` type of Hit Animal, so it might be possible to identify the missing values from this information.

> -------------------------------------------------

### Fixing data in bulk via Common Transformations

#### Trim Leading and trailing whitespace using facets

Words with spaces at the beginning or end are particularly hard for we humans to tell from strings, but the blank characters will make a difference to the computer. We usually want to remove these at the beginning of a project.  OpenRefine provides a tool to remove blank characters from the beginning and end of any entries that have them.

#### Activity 9 – Common transformations

Create a new text facet for the column `Local_Police_Region`. You should see some choices that appear identical (Central and South Eastern have two choices). One of these choices must include either leading or trailing whitespace.

To remove the whitespace, choose `Edit cells > Common transforms > Trim leading and trailing whitespace`.

You should now see only five choices in your text facet.
### Using clustering to detect possible typing errors

Another very useful feature of OpenRefine is Clustering.  In OpenRefine, clustering means 'finding groups of different values that might be alternative representations of the same thing'. For example, the text strings 'New York', 'new york'  or 'New Yrok' (write on board) very likely refer to the same concept.

Clustering is a very powerful tool for identifying and fixing datasets which contain misspelled or mistyped entries.

OpenRefine has several clustering algorithms built in. Let's experiment with them.

#### Activity 10 – Fixing errors via Clustering

Create a Text Facet for `Crash_Nature`, scroll through the list.  You will notice a number of values  that are likely mis-typed entries due to various factors.  (Ask for examples and reward with prizes).

Click the `Cluster` button, on the top right of the facet.

In the resulting pop-up window, different edit options and algorithms are available via drop down boxes.

Select the `key collision` method and `fingerprint` keying function. It should identify one cluster with 3 value options.

Click the `Merge?` box beside the cluster, then click `Merge Selected and Re-cluster` to apply the corrections to the dataset.

Try selecting different Methods and Keying Functions combinations, to see if new merges are suggested.

There may be a few more clusters, to fix misspellings, typos, capitalisation, hyphens, etc.

How many choices are now shown in the facet?  13 (prize).

Close the facet.

*Important: Some merges are not necessary. Nearest neighbour with a radius of 2.0 with find Struck by external load with Struck by internal load.  These are valid variables, do not merge these.*
