{% include figure.html img="GC_Campus_LM-3181.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="75%" %}

Open Refine is an open source tool to explore, clean, organise, combine and transform data. OpenRefine is particularly powerful when working with large datasets. 

Learn basic data cleaning techniques in this self-paced online workshop such as:

- exploring tabular data through facets and filters
- implementing â€˜tidy data' principles
- cleaning, organising and preparing data for analysis
- extracting and using a script to automate wrangling on similar data

Many users comment that OpenRefine saves them months of work trying to edit and clean by hand. This 2 1/2 hour workshop will take you through the steps from ideas and spreadsheets, to reproducible analysable data sets. Download the software and open data, do the activities and watch the videos to guide you through the lessons.
