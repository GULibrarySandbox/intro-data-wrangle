## Introduction to Data Wrangling with OpenRefine

{% include figure.html img="GC_Campus_LM-3181.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="75%" %}

A self-paced online workshop to learn basic data cleaning techniques using Open Refine, an open source tool to scrutinize, clean, organise, combine and transform data. The tool automatically tracks changes made to the data, producing a script to enable reproducibility and documentation to provide verification. It is particularly powerful when working with large datasets. Many people comment that this tool saves them months of work trying to edit and clean by hand. 

Learn these data wrangling skills:
- explore tabular data through facets and filters
- implement â€˜tidy data' principles
- clean, organise and prepare data for analysis
- use basic features of OpenRefine
- extract and reuse a reproducible script to repeat processing on similar data
