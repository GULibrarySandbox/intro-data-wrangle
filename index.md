{% include figure.html img="GC_Campus_LM-3181.jpg" alt="intro image here" caption="" width="75%" %}

A self-paced online workshop to learn basic data cleaning techniques using Open Refine, an open source tool to explore, clean, organise, combine and transform data. It is particularly powerful when working with large datasets. Many people comment that this tool saves them months of work trying to edit and clean by hand. 

Learn these data wrangling skills using OpenRefine:
- explore tabular data through facets and filters
- implement â€˜tidy data' principles
- clean, organise and prepare data for analysis
- extract and reuse a reproducible script to repeat processing on similar data
